# StringLights-SnowFlakes-2020
Tri-Color Snowflake Ordainment String Lights that are able to be changed via a H-10 Bluetooth module via Cellular communication.

Using Ardunio Uno Software

This project will include soldering together several different LEDS and attaching them to Snowflake ordainments. Once the LEDs have been attached and wired in a parallel and series circuit connection, where appropriate. Then by adding a bluetooth H-10 module to an ardunio, I am able to send various functions over to the string lights to creat different patterns through my phone using the pre-built IOS application associated with the H-10 model that was purchased.
